<br>
I once lived a happy life\\
Black and White\\
Favorite color Black\\
Clothes Black\\
Humor dark\\
Accessories black\\
Heart black\\
Mind\\
peaceful as white

<br>
Then you came\\
with colors of different shades\\
which I had never come across\\
I didn't know till then\\
that I was color blind\\
I mistook purple with grey\\
and green and yellow were same\\
You came as a rainbow for me\\
I loved the colors you brought along\\
It made my life colorful\\
Favorite color blue (or green was it?)\\
Heart colorful\\
Mind\\
still peaceful as white\\
But as the rainbow lives only for a while\\
so did you\\
You left\\
and No you didn't leave the colors behind\\
You gave me an experience of a lifetime\\
And funnily you stole a color from me\\
It sure is the white\\
Funny, isn't it?\\
As for other colors\\
It doesn't matter\\
cause I am color blind\\
But you stole the only color\\
that mattered to my mind\\
You stole my peace\\
You stole my white

<br>
Now I'm back to square one\\
living a life (happy?)\\
Black life\\
with some hope to see colors again\\
longing for peace\\
yearning for the white.
