<br><br>

Just so when you are alone,\\
And memories are long gone.\\
Nobody is there with you to talk,\\
And no one to take a walk.\\
You lie down on the bed,\\
Thinking Am I too bad?\\
Stroll down to see people smile,\\
And hope for the moment to last a while.\\
When it appears the dark sun shade,\\
You sit alone and watch people fade.\\
So what if you bore that creepy smile,\\
And your attempts to be happy are futile.\\
I know, in a day a thousand times you die,\\
And still you are too strong to cry.\\
Those empty roads and vacant bungalows,\\
All shake you from head to toes.\\
When loneliness is what craves your attention,\\
and emptiness is what frees you from tension,\\
So what if you suffer from all those depression,\\
You ain’t gonna need any sympathy to mention. .\\

I don’t know what I wrote but I just did. Sorry if it doesn’t make sense at the end. Because being happy all the time also doesn’t, right?\\
